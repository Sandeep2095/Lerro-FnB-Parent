              A 19-year-old dropout kid, who was just setting up his first
              venture, envisioned what nobody thought would make him a business
              tycoon in the hospitality industry. Once he began, there was no
              stopping this entrepreneur from reaching the heights he has
              reached today. It is the passion and creative streak of Priyank
              Sukhija that has made him the most watched-out restaurateur of
              todayâ€™s time. Coming from a family of lawyers, he ventured into
              the business world on his own with Lazeez Affaire in 1999 and has
              never looked back since.
